0. These instructions assume Debian or Ubuntu.

Most of the examples of optimized code are for AVX2 (Haswell and newer)
and won't run on other platforms. saferewrite automatically skips the
implementations that don't run and analyzes the implementations that do.

Some of the current analyses use 100GB of RAM, although most use less.
Also, saferewrite will automatically run multiple analyses in parallel
if many cores are available, and has been observed using 1TB of RAM
overall. These instructions include mechanisms to select particular
analyses and to limit parallelism, but it is good to use a modern server
with a reasonable amount of RAM.


1. First time, as root, install packages:

   apt install python3 virtualenvwrapper build-essential clang valgrind

All subsequent steps are unprivileged.


2. First time, as user, create a saferewrite environment:

   mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 saferewrite

If this doesn't work, try running

   . /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.sh

first, or try a new shell.

If your system has pypy3 then you can use that instead of python3 here,
and run "pypy3 ./analyze &" below. This can save a considerable fraction
of unrolling time but doesn't help for Z3 time, which is typically a
bigger bottleneck.


3. First time, as user, install angr within the saferewrite environment:

   pip install angr


4. Subsequent times, as user, switch to the saferewrite environment:

   workon saferewrite

If this doesn't work, try running

   . /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.sh

first, or try a new shell, as in step 3.


5. Optionally, in this directory, narrow the analysis to cmp* (or
whichever subdirectories you're interested in under src):

   chmod +t src/*
   chmod -t src/cmp*


6. In this directory, analyze everything:

   ./analyze &

This will put results in a ./build directory, wiping out any previous
./build results.

The analysis automatically runs on as many cores as it can find. If you
want to limit the number of cores:

   env CORES=1 ./analyze &

If you want to interrupt the analysis, use SIGTERM (kill with default
options) rather than SIGINT (^C).


7. Look at the analysis results:

   ls -1 build/*/*/*/analysis/*

To see examples showing implementations are different:

   less build/*/*/*/analysis/*different*

To see what the analysis thinks each implementation is doing:

   less build/*/*/*/analysis/unrolled
   
   
 We have two sets of functions those 
 Those in C and those in C++.

Beginning of Work from saferewrite

To run C++, you have to : 
 
   	chmod +t src/*
   	chmod -t src/seal_u_exponentiate_uint
   	chmod -t src/seal_u_exponentiate_uint_safe
   	chmod -t src/seal_p_get_coeff_power
	chmod -t src/seal_ntt
   
To run the C program,
change the analyze file from canalyze to analayze then run the following commands:

	chmod +t src/*
   	chmod -t src/seal_load64
   	chmod -t src/seal_sha3_512
   	chmod -t src/seal_Store64
   	chmod -t src/seal_blake2b
