Implementing cryptographic algorithms in software or hardware can introduce vulnerabilities 
such as memory leaks, race conditions, temporary hardware storage exposure, and power or timing 
side-channels. This research investigates the security and efficiency of commonly used 
homomorphic encryption algorithms and libraries across both software and hardware implementations.
